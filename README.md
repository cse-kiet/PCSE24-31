Hand Gestures Recognition System
Overview
This repository contains a Hand Gestures Recognition System that utilizes MediaPipe for keypoints detection, OpenCV for object detection, and Handsfree.js for hand landmarks. The system is designed to recognize various hand gestures and can be used for applications such as controlling applications with hand movements, sign language recognition, and more.

Features
Hand Keypoints Detection: Utilizes MediaPipe to detect and track hand keypoints.
Object Detection: Uses OpenCV for detecting objects within the video stream.
Hand Landmarks: Employs Handsfree.js to extract detailed hand landmarks.
Real-time Processing: Processes video streams in real-time to recognize hand gestures.
Cross-platform: Works on various platforms including Windows, macOS, and Linux.
Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.6 or higher
Node.js and npm
OpenCV
MediaPipe
Handsfree.js
Setup
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hand-gestures-recognition-system.git
cd hand-gestures-recognition-system
Install Python dependencies:

Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install required packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Install Node.js dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Usage
Running the System
Start the Python backend:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
This will start the backend server that handles object detection using OpenCV and keypoints detection with MediaPipe.

Start the frontend:

Open index.html in your browser. This file includes the integration with Handsfree.js for hand landmarks detection.

Customizing Gestures
To add or modify gestures, update the gestures.js file with the corresponding hand landmarks and logic.
